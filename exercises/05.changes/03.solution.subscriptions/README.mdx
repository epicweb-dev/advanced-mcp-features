# Subscriptions

👨‍💼 Way to go! We've just unlocked real-time updates for our users by enabling resource subscriptions. Now, whenever someone is working with a specific journal entry, tag, or video, the app can instantly notify them of any changes—no more stale data or manual refreshes. This means users always have the most up-to-date information at their fingertips, making their journaling experience seamless and trustworthy.

By supporting the `subscribe` capability, we've ensured that our app feels alive and responsive, keeping users in sync with their most important content. This is a huge win for anyone who relies on timely, accurate updates—whether they're reflecting on their latest entry, organizing tags, or reviewing a video.

What a fantastic way to wrap up our journey through change notifications and real-time collaboration!
