# Resource Template List Changed

👨‍💼 Outstanding work! Our app now keeps the list of available resources—like journal entries, tags, and videos—perfectly in sync with what's actually possible for the user, thanks to the new `list_changed` notification for resource templates. Now, whenever a user adds a new video reflection, creates a fresh tag, or updates their journal, the UI updates instantly.

Let's keep going!
