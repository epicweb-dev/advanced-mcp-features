# List Changed

👨‍💼 Fantastic progress! Our app now supports real-time updates for journaling
prompts, thanks to the new `list_changed` notification capability. Whenever a
prompt is enabled or disabled (like when a new journaling feature becomes
available or an old one is retired), the client is instantly notified and
can refresh its list. This means users always see the most relevant options,
with no confusion or stale choices lingering in the interface.

Let's keep building on this momentum to make the experience even better!

🧝‍♀️ I'm applying the same pattern we used for prompts to resources and tools.
If you want extra practice, try it yourself—it's the same approach! Or
just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink> if you'd rather skip
ahead.
