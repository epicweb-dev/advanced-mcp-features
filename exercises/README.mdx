üë®‚Äçüíº Hello, my name is Peter the Product Manager. I'm here to help you get
oriented and to give you your assignments for the workshop!

Welcome to **Advanced MCP Features**! In this workshop, you'll dive into the world of
the
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)‚Äîan
open protocol designed to seamlessly connect AI models with external data
sources and tools. We'll be going deeper on the MCP spec and how to use it to
build more advanced AI connected apps.

We'll focus on advanced features of the spec, however we'll not be covering
authentication or authorization (that's an entire workshop in itself).

We'll be using the
[MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)
to build our MCP server and the
[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to test it.

If you're curious about the details, I highly recommend checking out the
[official MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18)
and the [introduction](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). These
resources provide a deep dive into the protocol, its design principles, and
practical implementation tips.

	**NOTE**: At the time of this writing, most clients don't support the features
	that we're going to be learning about in this workshop. So a lot of what we'll
	be doing is theoretical, and the knowledge you acquire in this workshop won't
	be immediately practical until we get more clients that support these
	features. That said, when we do get these features, you'll be ready to hit the
	ground running.

Ready to build even better AI connected apps? Then let's get going!
