# Simple Sampling

üë®‚Äçüíº Our users love the prompt functionality, but they asked why the LLM couldn't
just suggest tags when they create the post and we thought that's a great idea!

So now your goal is to make your server request a simple completion from the
language model whenever a new journal entry is created.

In this first step, we'll just get things wired up and then we'll work on our
prompt for the LLM in the next step.

**Here's what you'll do:**

- When the create_entry tool is called, call the `suggestTagsSampling` function
  with the agent and the createdEntry.id.
- We don't want to wait for the sampling function to finish so instead of "await"
  use "void" which effectively ignores the promise.
- First check if the client supports sampling. If it does, proceed with the
  sampling request.
- Implement a function that sends a sampling request to the client using
  `agent.server.server.createMessage` (the `server.server` thing is funny, but
  our MCP server manages an internal server and that's what we're accessing).
- Use a simple system prompt (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant.") and a user
  message that references the new journal entry's ID (we'll enhance this next).
- Set a reasonable `maxTokens` value for the response.
- Parse the model's response using a provided Zod schema.
- Log the result to the console so you can inspect the model's output.

And don't forget to call it when the user creates a new journal entry!

Here's an example of how to check if the client supports sampling:

```ts
// the server.server is how the MCP SDK exposes the underlying server
// instance for more advanced APIs like this one.
const capabilities = agent.server.server.getClientCapabilities()
if (!capabilities?.sampling) {
	console.error('Client does not support sampling, skipping sampling request')
	return
}
// Proceed with sampling request here
```

The `maxTokens` option references the max tokens the model should return.

<callout-warning>
	The `system prompt` + `messages` + `OUTPUT MESSAGE` can't exceed the context
	window size of the model your user is using.
</callout-warning>

This step will help you get comfortable with the basic request/response flow for
sampling in MCP, and set the stage for more advanced prompt engineering in the
next step.

There are tests to help verify your sampling request is working.

To test this in the MCP inspector:

- run the `create_entry` tool
- check the "Sampling" navigation tab and you should have a sampling request
- at this point, YOU are the LLM. You can copy paste this into your response:

```json
{
	"model": "stub-model",
	"stopReason": "endTurn",
	"role": "assistant",
	"content": {
		"type": "text",
		"text": "Good job!"
	}
}
```
