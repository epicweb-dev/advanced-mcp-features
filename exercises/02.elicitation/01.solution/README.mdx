# Elicite Confirmation

👨‍💼 Fantastic progress! We've just introduced a robust confirmation step for destructive actions, such as deleting a tag. Now, whenever a user initiates an action that could have significant consequences, the system pauses and asks for explicit confirmation using a structured elicitation prompt. This ensures that users are always in control and never accidentally lose important data.

By leveraging the Model Context Protocol's elicitation feature, our app now provides a clear, user-friendly dialog that requests confirmation before proceeding. If the user decides not to confirm, the action is gracefully cancelled and the user receives immediate feedback—no tags are deleted unless the user truly intends it.

This enhancement significantly improves trust and safety in our workflow, making sure that every important action is intentional and reversible. It's a big win for user experience and peace of mind!

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to be adding more utilities and introducing sampling features to make our app even smarter. Feel free to try it yourself or just <NextDiffLink>check out my changes</NextDiffLink> if you're interested.
