👨‍💼 Outstanding achievement! We've now brought structured output to our journaling tools, ensuring every action in EpicMe returns information in a clear, machine-validated format. This means users can trust that their memories, reflections, and daily adventures are always organized and reliably presented—no more cryptic or unpredictable responses. The UI can now display journal entries, tags, and magical creatures (😉) with confidence, knowing exactly what to expect from each tool. This upgrade not only makes the experience more seamless and delightful for our users, but also paves the way for smarter automation and safer interactions throughout the app.

With structured output in place, EpicMe is even better equipped to help users capture and revisit their stories, making every journaling moment feel effortless and secure. Let's keep building on this momentum!
