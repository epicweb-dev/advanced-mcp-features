# Annotations

👨‍💼 Fantastic progress! We've successfully introduced annotations to our journaling tools. Now, each tool clearly communicates its intent—whether it's read-only, destructive, idempotent, or open world. This means users and the system can better understand the impact of each action, leading to a safer and more predictable journaling experience. For example, deleting an entry is now marked as idempotent, while creating a tag is clearly non-destructive. These improvements help ensure that users can confidently manage their journal and tags, knowing exactly what each tool is designed to do.

Let's keep up the momentum as we continue to enhance the user experience!
