👨‍💼 Outstanding progress! We've just empowered our users with the ability to cancel long-running operations—like generating their personalized wrapped video—at any time. This means that if a user changes their mind, makes a mistake, or simply needs to stop the process, they can do so instantly, without waiting for the task to finish.

This enhancement puts users in control, making the app feel faster, more flexible, and responsive. No more feeling stuck or frustrated by accidental requests or long waits. And it's more efficient for our servers as well to not continue processing a request that was cancelled. Now, users can confidently start and stop operations as needed, knowing the system will respect their choices and free up resources right away.

Let's keep building on this momentum to deliver even more delightful, user-centric experiences!
