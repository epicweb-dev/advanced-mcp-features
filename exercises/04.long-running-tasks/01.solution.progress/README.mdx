# Progress Updates

👨‍💼 Fantastic news! We've just made waiting for a journal wrapped video a much better experience. Now, when users request their video, they receive real-time progress updates throughout the process. Instead of staring at a blank screen and wondering if anything is happening, users see clear, friendly notifications that keep them in the loop from start to finish.

This means users always know their request is being handled, and they can follow along as their video is assembled—making the wait feel shorter and the experience more delightful. Progress updates transform a long-running task into a transparent, engaging journey, building trust and satisfaction with every step.

Let's keep this momentum going and continue making our app a joy to use!
