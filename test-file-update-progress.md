# Epic AI Workshop Test File Update Progress

## Summary
I have systematically updated the test files for the iterative MCP workshop exercises. Each exercise builds on the previous one, and the tests have been tailored to only include features that should be implemented at each step.

## ‚úÖ Completed Exercise Updates

### 1. Exercise 01 - Advanced Tools
- **Step 1 (annotations)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Tests: Basic tool definitions, annotations (destructiveHint, openWorldHint, idempotentHint, readOnlyHint)
  - Solution test: PASSING
  - Problem test: FAILING with helpful errors (missing annotations)

- **Step 2 (structured)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
  - Tests: Annotations + outputSchema and structuredContent
  - Solution test: PASSING
  - Problem test: FAILING with helpful errors (missing outputSchema)

### 2. Exercise 02 - Elicitation
- **Step 1**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Tests: Previous features + elicitation for delete_tag tool
  - Solution test: PASSING  
  - Problem test: FAILING with helpful errors (missing elicitation)

### 3. Exercise 03 - Sampling
- **Step 1 (simple)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
  - Tests: Previous features + basic sampling functionality
  - Focused on simple sampling requirements (not advanced JSON features)

## üîÑ In Progress

### Exercise 03 - Sampling (continued)
- **Step 2 (advanced)**: Ready to implement
  - Should add: Advanced sampling with JSON content, detailed prompts, higher maxTokens
  - Based on the diff analysis, this step adds sophisticated prompt engineering

### Exercise 04 - Long-running Tasks
- **Step 1 (progress)**: Ready to implement
  - Should add: Progress notifications for create_wrapped_video tool
- **Step 2 (cancellation)**: Ready to implement  
  - Should add: Cancellation support with AbortSignal

### Exercise 05 - Changes  
- **Step 1 (list-changed)**: Ready to implement
  - Should add: Basic listChanged capabilities for prompts
- **Step 2 (resources-list-changed)**: Ready to implement
  - Should add: ListChanged for tools and resources, dynamic enabling/disabling
- **Step 3 (subscriptions)**: ‚úÖ HAS FINAL VERSION
  - This is the source of the comprehensive test file

## üìã Implementation Pattern

For each remaining exercise step:

1. **Git Diff Analysis**: Understand what features the step adds by comparing with previous step
2. **Test Tailoring**: Remove tests for features not yet implemented
3. **Solution Testing**: Ensure `node ./epicshop/test.js X.Y.solution -- --no-watch` passes
4. **Problem Copying**: Copy test to problem directory  
5. **Problem Testing**: Ensure `node ./epicshop/test.js X.Y.problem -- --no-watch` fails with helpful errors

## üéØ Key Feature Progression

### Exercise 03 (Sampling)
- **Simple**: Basic sampling with simple prompts (low maxTokens, text/plain)
- **Advanced**: JSON content (application/json), detailed prompts with examples, higher maxTokens, result parsing

### Exercise 04 (Long-running Tasks)  
- **Progress**: Progress notifications during mock video creation
- **Cancellation**: AbortSignal support for canceling operations

### Exercise 05 (Changes)
- **List-changed**: Basic prompt listChanged notifications
- **Resources-list-changed**: Tool/resource listChanged + dynamic enabling/disabling  
- **Subscriptions**: Resource subscription and update notifications

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Continue with Exercise 03 Step 2**: Add advanced sampling features
2. **Exercise 04**: Implement progress and cancellation tests
3. **Exercise 05 Steps 1-2**: Implement change notification tests  
4. **Final Validation**: Run all tests and formatting/linting

## üìÅ File Structure

Each exercise follows this pattern:
```
exercises/XX.feature-name/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YY.problem.step-name/src/index.test.ts
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YY.solution.step-name/src/index.test.ts
```

The test files are identical between problem and solution pairs, but differ between steps to reflect progressive feature implementation.

## üß™ Test Command Pattern

- Solution: `node ./epicshop/test.js X.Y.solution -- --no-watch`
- Problem: `node ./epicshop/test.js X.Y.problem -- --no-watch`

Where X = exercise number, Y = step number.

## ‚ú® Quality Assurance

All completed tests include:
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages with üö® emojis for learner guidance
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive feature validation  
- ‚úÖ Structured assertions that explain what learners need to implement
- ‚úÖ Progressive complexity that builds on previous exercises
